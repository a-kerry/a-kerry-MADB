            <summary>Dehumanisation of creativity:</summary>
            <p>It is proposed that AI tools can dehumanise creativity by challenging traditional notions of human agency, expression, emotion, and labour involved in regular creative processes.</p>

            <p>Additionally, as AI lacks human experience and emotions that drive creative work, this can potentially lessen the role of human’s creators, raising questions over the authenticity of AI-generated projects.

        <summary>Perspective of Viewers:</summary>
        <br>
            <p>With content creators adopting AI tools, this has the possibility to jepordise the realtionship with fans and viewers:
             <br> A case Example is that of Youtuber, Jordi van den Bussche, known as 'Kwebbelkop'. A gaming youtuber who  adopted various AI tools, creating a 'clone' version of himself creating content without him in it.
             <br>
             As seen here at an AI event: </p>
             <img id="kwebbelkop" src="images/kwebbelkop.png" alt="AI Tools Infographic">
             <p> For a period of time the Youtuber did use the AI tools created however due to backlash and negative feedback from audiences, decided not to continue with the 'Clone'. 
            <br>
                 
            A take on this topic comes from Lia Haberman, an influencer marketing expert and instructor at UCLA. Who stated, “This presents an entirely new option for creators to essentially clone themselves and continue without worrying about aging, gaining weight, or otherwise evolving in any way that could alienate certain segments of their audience,”.
            <br>
            But however is not fully convinced by these content types, stating Their appeal “is their humanity and ability to create these parasocial relationships with their audience where people either relate to them or aspire to become them,” she says. “A virtual influencer will only ever present as entertainment, at least until we get to sentient beings.”

    <h2>Why AI is incredibly smart and shockingly stupid - Yejin Choi </h2>
    <br>

    <p>Computer scientist Yejin Choi is here to demystify the current state of massive artificial intelligence systems like ChatGPT, highlighting three key problems with cutting-edge large language models (including some funny instances of them failing at basic commonsense reasoning.) 
    <br>She welcomes us into a new era in which AI is becoming almost like a new intellectual species -- and identifies the benefits of building smaller AI systems trained on human norms and values. (Followed by a Q&A with head of TED Chris Anderson </p>
