        <h2>Overview of the Disadvantages of AI tools for creative video projects</h2>
        <br>
        <p>While AI offers new possibilities for creative expression, it also poses challenges to the unique qualities and personal experiences that human creators bring to their work. Where there is the possibility of related disadvantages such as the Dehumanisation of creativity</p>
        <br>

                    <summary>Dehumanisation of creativity</summary>
                    <p>It is proposed that AI tools can dehumanise creativity by challenging traditional notions of human agency, expression, emotion, and labour involved in regular creative processes.
                    <br> <br> When AI creates art, it has the potential to overshadow human creators, raising questions about the authenticity and originality of video content created.
                    <br> <br> Furthermore, AI's cost-cutting abilities for creative companies, can threaten human jobs. An example of this is the Writers Guild of America’s strike, which demanded that motion picture and television studios safeguard their jobs from the use of AI. 
                    </p>
                    <p> Overall, while AI offers new possibilities, it also raises concerns about the role of human emotion and labour in the creative process. </p>

                    <summary>AI's lack of human understanding</summary>
                    <p> It is argued that  AI tools lack a basic understanding of human values, socially and emotionally.<br>
                        As AI lacks human experience and emotions that drive creative work, and provide resonance with audiences creating a connection between creator and viewer based upon shared experiences.
                    <br> <br> Therefore, AI tools can potentially lessen the role of human creators, raising questions over the authenticity of AI-generated projects. 
                    <br> <br> Relative to content creators who employ AI tools for their video projects, this could result in the audience questioning the creator’s authenticity, affecting viewer-creator relationships.</p>

                    <summary>Chat GPT - Limited access</summary>
                    <p>The Following example of Chat GPT represents how the tool is unable to access to the internet and therefore cannot keep up with relevant data. Furthermore, cannot analyse video links or files and provide feedback to creators.</p>

                    <p>These forms of Limitations can be very impactful as ideas and guidance may be outdated and not support creators appropriately. </p>

                    <summary>Perspective of Viewers</summary>
                    <br>
                    <p>With content creators adopting AI tools, this has the possibility to jeopardise the relationship with fans and viewers:
                        <br> A case example is that of Youtuber, Jordi van den Bussche, known as 'Kwebbelkop'. A gaming creator who adopted various AI tools, creating a 'clone' version of himself creating content without him in it.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        As seen here at an AI event: </p>
                    <img id="kwebbelkop" src="images/kwebbelkop.png" alt="Kwebbelkop instagram photo, Kwebbelkop next to AI avatar">
                    <br>
                    <p> For a period of time the Youtuber did use the AI tools created however due to backlash and negative feedback from audiences, decided not to continue with the 'Clone'. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        A take on this topic comes from Lia Haberman, an influencer marketing expert and instructor at UCLA. Who stated, “This presents an entirely new option for creators to essentially clone themselves and continue without worrying about ageing, gaining weight, or otherwise evolving in any way that could alienate certain segments of their audience,”.
                        However, is not fully convinced by these content types, stating Their appeal “is their humanity and ability to create these social relationships with their audience where people either relate to them or aspire to become them,” she says. “A virtual influencer will only ever present as entertainment, at least until we get to sentient beings.”
