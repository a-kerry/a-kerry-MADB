 tools: 
 
  Additionally, I often used webpages such as W3schools, CSS tricks and various YouTube tutorials to support the technical development of my project. 
  Finally, I adopted multiple AI tools throughout the development of my projecting using Chat-GPT to check for syntax errors and re-arrange my code appropriately. I also             used Grammarly to check the writing in my webpage for any spelling or grammar errors to support the readability of content.
